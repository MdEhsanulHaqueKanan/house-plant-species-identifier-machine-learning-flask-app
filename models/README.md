# Model Storage

This directory is intended to store the pre-trained model weights.

The model file (`house_plant_classifier_v1.pth`) is not tracked by Git. You must download it manually and place it in this directory for the application to work.

**[Download the model file from Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAICG_FhkrZAnGURVBRlp3KFsAgQ092t/view?usp=sharing)**
