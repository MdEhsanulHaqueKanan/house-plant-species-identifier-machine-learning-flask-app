# Model Weights Storage

This directory stores the `house_plant_classifier_v1.pth` file, which contains the final trained weights for the plant classification model used in this application.

### About the Model
This model was custom-trained by me on a dataset of 47 house plant species using the Kaggle platform. The complete training process, including data augmentation, model architecture (fine-tuning an EfficientNet-B0), and evaluation, is documented in the Jupyter Notebook located at `/notebook/house-plant-identification.ipynb`.

This `.pth` file represents the final state of the model after that training was successfully completed.

### Action Required
The model weights file is not tracked by Git due to its size. You must download it manually from the link below and place it directly in this `models/` directory for the application to function.
